# StepAhead
## Hackathon project for Our Wave Hub's ODYSSEY Hackathon 2022
Climate change is a serious issue and is getting worse as time progresses. People are relying more and more on cars rather than using green methods of transportation such as busing, biking or walking. As a result, we created an app that incentivizes people to use greener methods of transportation so they are rewarded and feel motivated to reduce their carbon footprint. 

### Main Tools Used
- **Swift** - The language used to make the app
- **XCode** - The IDE used to run and test the app
- **MapKit** - The library used to implement the map feature in the app 

### To Run The App
1. Clone this repository and open it in XCode 
2. Install the required packages in XCode (Firebase)
3. Build the project
4. The app should be working successfully

### Contributions
- **Harsharan & Ishnu** - Created User Interface for shopping and rewards page. Also pitched the idea to the judges.
- **Thuvaragan** - Worked on code merging, navbar, and other integrations.
- **Manjot** - Created the program to pinpoint all locations around Brampton and Map design using MapKit.
- **Yatharth** - Documented the project and prepared the presentation for the pitch.
